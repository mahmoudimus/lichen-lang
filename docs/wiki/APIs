The principal application programming interfaces (APIs) within Lichen are described below.

== Modules ==

When [[../Inspection|inspecting]] and [[../Translation|translating]] modules, common abstractions are used so that elements of the program are handled in similar ways. Various useful attributes and methods are provided by the `CommonModule` abstraction for use within `InspectedModule` and `TranslatedModule` methods:

{{{#!table
'''Attribute or Method''' || '''Purpose'''
==
`name` ||
An attribute providing the module name.
==
`get_global_path(name)` ||
A method returning the qualified name of the given global name within the module being processed.
==
`get_namespace_path()` ||
A method returning the qualified name of the namespace being processed.
 * For modules, this is the module name
 * For classes, functions and methods, the path incorporates the module name and namespaces leading to the current namespace itself
==
`get_object_path(name)` ||
A method returning the qualified name of the given local name within the namespace being processed.
