The software currently requires Python to operate. All recent development has
been done using Python 2.7 which should be available for most operating system
distributions. In future, Lichen will hopefully be compiled using its own
toolchain and not require Python. See the Debian `python-minimal` or `python`
packages or their equivalents.

To produce executable programs, a C compiler and GNU make are required. The GNU
C compiler, GCC, has been used for development and testing, and it should be
available in various forms for most operating system distributions. Indeed,
cross-compiling form of GCC has been used to test the toolchain output. See the
Debian `gcc` and `make` packages or their equivalents.

As Free Software, priority has been given to supporting Lichen on Free Software
platforms, with Debian GNU/Linux being the development platform. Proprietary
platforms are neither supported nor recommended.
